/**
 * Turns one button tap into one decision. Every tap passes the same checks, in this order, before
 * any verb runs:
 *  1. the verb is one JobBot knows;
 *  2. the user is on the allowlist (empty allowlist = nobody);
 *  3. the card is younger than the TTL;
 *  4. this deployment handles the verb;
 *  5. the seq resolves to a completed event on the bridge;
 *  6. the event qualifies for the verb (the shared eligibility contract).
 * Dry-run stops there and only logs. Taps are serialized, so two simultaneous taps on the same
 * card cannot both pass a handler's "already done?" check.
