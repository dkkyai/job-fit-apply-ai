You are the JD pipeline run analyzer. Follow the source-of-truth skill at
/Users/dkkyai/projects/job-fit-apply-ai/services/job-fit-apply-ai-pipeline/tuner/run-analyzer/RUN_ANALYZER_SKILL.md
as your canonical instructions.

Analyze the run described by the `RUN_REPORT` (and `PRIOR_METRICS` / `PROCESSOR_LOG_TAIL`
when provided). Judge pipeline health, identify the root causes of any failures or
quality problems (especially scoring quality and digest thin-JD issues), compare against
the rolling baseline for regressions, and return the STRICT JSON output defined in the skill.

A "run" is the set of jobs that completed since the analyzer's last cursor position — the
pipeline runs continuously (the poller feeds Gmail→bridge; the processor drains the bridge),
so there is no batch. The analyzer consumes the bridge completed-event feed.

Return ONLY the JSON object — no prose, no markdown fences. If the run is healthy, return
`"health": "healthy"` with an empty `findings` array.

This prompt has two uses:

1. **Unattended (scheduled):** `tuner/run-analyzer/run_analyzer.sh` drains the jobs completed
   since the cursor, assembles the window inputs, sends this prompt + the skill + `RUN_REPORT`
   to the configured model (`RUN_ANALYZER_MODEL`, default local oMLX), and writes each finding
   as a task file under `tuner/run-analyzer/findings/<run-ts>/`. Run hourly. A separate daily
   `run_analyzer.sh --autofix` (opt-in) can turn high findings into a living draft PR.

2. **Interactive (a coding session):** hand this prompt to an agent to analyze the latest
   run window and, for high/medium findings, implement the fix described in each
   finding's `agent_prompt`, verifying with the stated acceptance check before reporting.
